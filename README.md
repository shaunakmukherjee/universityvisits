Hello and welcome to University Visits!

Also, we assume 'pip', Python, Django, etc. are pre-installed, if not repeat the first step.

To run the code, please follow the following steps :

1. install the requirements by $pip install -r requirements.txt
2. activate the virtual environment 'dev' by $ source dev/bin/activate
3. now that it's activated, just go to the main directory and type $python manage.py runserver

Now hit up your favourite browser and type 'localhost:8000' on the address bar.
The site should show up.
Enjoy!

~ Shaun.
